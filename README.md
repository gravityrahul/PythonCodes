10 Questions on LinkedList

SELECTED LINKED LIST QUESTIONS TO PRACTICE
1.
Consider sorted singly linked list having following nodes 10->30->50->70->NULL 
You are given pointer to node 50 and a new node having value 40. Can you inserted node 40 
correctly in the list maintaining the ascending order?

1B.
Generate a LinkedList which automatically sorts elements inserted. That is create a  self sorted LinkedList.


2.
Delete the repeated elements in a singly linked list in O(n) time complexity without 
using extra space. Linked list contains elements in unsorted order 
P.S. - Sorting is not allowed

3.
Given two singly linked list, find if they are intersecting. Do this in single iteration. 
Also find the intersecting node in O(n) time and O(1) space. By intersection 
I mean intersection by reference not by value

4.
Write a function to find 5th element from a singly linked List from the end(not from the head) 
in one pass.

5.
Reverse the doubly linked list without using extra space.

6.
Append the last n nodes of a linked list to the beginning of the list eg: 1->2->3->4->5->6 
if n=2 5->6->1->2->3->4

7.
Given two linked lists combine them in a way such that the resultant must contain the elements 
alternatively from one list and the other list? For ex. LL1 : 1->2->3->4 LL2 : 5->6->7 Result : 1->5->2->6->3->7->4

8.
Given a head to linked list and integer as input, write a function to delete all matching 
elements in the linked list

9.
With a linked list data structure, find if a given string is palindrome or not.

10.
Given a linked list and two integers M and N. Scan the linked list such that you retain M nodes 
then delete next N nodes and continue the same till the end of linked list.
